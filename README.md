# A-Comprehensive-Analysis-of-United-Airlines-Flight-Gains-from-New-York-City

This project focuses on analyzing the operational efficiency of United Airlines (UA) flights, with an emphasis on the concept of **gain per flight**, a metric that captures the deviation between scheduled and actual timelines. Using the `nycflights13` dataset, this analysis evaluates UA's flight performance by deriving and studying the net gain metric, calculated as the difference between arrival delay and departure delay. Key questions explored include the impact of departure delays on average gain, the gain patterns of major destination airports, and the relationship between gain per hour, departure delays, and flight durations. Statistical techniques such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing are applied to uncover actionable insights, enabling strategic decision-making to enhance UA's operational efficiency and flight services.
